	Although there were complications initially due to scheduling and work-related projects, I dived into as much documentation and research as possible during the first 4-5 days. This assessment is unique as I had not configured an EC2 instance before, but I took this assignment seriously as this really pushed how much I know about AWS and scripting. First step was navigating around the EC2 console and understanding how to manually activate an instance. Second step was unpacking necessary tools like AWS Tools and OpenSSH to assist with access of AWS. Third step went into understanding how to toggle the instance process and make the server come to life. There were many pieces to this step, going through many testings to slowly reach the right instance needed. Fourth step goes into SSH, this part is a bit buggy as the instance goes in and out of access with public IP. Last step, putting together the termination of the server was not an issue, as it is very similar to creating one. This was quite the challenge, definitely interesting and eye-opening. Thank you.
