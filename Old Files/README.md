# DevOps Take Home Assignment

We are most interested in how you go about learning the tools and environment and how you decompose the problem. As such, the problem does not have any particular "right" answer.

## The Test

For this challenge, you should create a set of scripts (or leverage existing scripts/tools) to do the following:

* Launch an EC2 instance in AWS running a Linux distribution of your choice
* Install a web server on the box that listens on port 80 (http)
* Allow access to the server from the public internet
* Write an additional script or command that will destroy that instance when you are done

The web server does not have to be configured to serve anything other than the default content. A 404 error response is perfectly acceptable.

## What We Look For

This test is not so much about proving you know "all the things" and more about showing how you work through problems like this. As such you are encouraged to reach out and bounce ideas off of us or to ask for guidance. You are also encouraged to share your research and thoughts as you work through the task in a README or notes document.

## Communicate With The Team

You will be invited to a Slack channel where you can ask us any and all questions in real-time (assuming business hours ðŸ˜„) as you go through the work.

## NOTE

Always be cautious with AWS keys/credentials and git repositories. We strongly suggest looking at "Named Profiles" which is supported by all official AWS tools and libraries and most third party tools working with AWS as well.
